        <h1>Safe Streets for Kevin</h1>
        <p>Dear friends,
          We are all deeply mourning the loss of our friend, Kevin Shaw.  It's the wish of his friends and family that action be taken immediately to improve the road crossing where he was hit.  This was a known dangerous crossing.  Steps have been taken by the town and state to make improvements, but we want to guarantee that quick action will be taken to prevent something like this from happening again.  Please help our cause by directly emailing the Acton Town Manager, John S. Mangiaratti, and Barry Lorion, who is the State District 3 Highway Director which includes jurisdiction over Great Road in Acton, MA.

				  &body=Dear Mr. Mangiaratti and Mr. Lorian,%0D%0AOn the evening of Thursday, October 13th, our friend and neighbor Kevin Shaw crossed Great Road in Acton.  He never made it to the other side.  He was hit by a car whose driver did not see him in the darkness and rain.  His family, friends, and MetroWest Community are mourning his loss and asking YOU to take action now.  I understand that plans are in motion to light this crosswalk, and I encourage you to complete those quickly.  In addition, please take short-term action such as putting interim lit signs there, glow in the dark paint or tape on the crosswalk, or other immediate steps so that no one else has to suffer a traffic loss like this.  
          %0D%0A%0D%0AThank you,%0D%0A
